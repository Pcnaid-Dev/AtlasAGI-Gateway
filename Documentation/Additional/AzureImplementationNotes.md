# Additional Changes for Azure OpenAI API Integration

This document outlines additional changes and considerations made during the migration from Ollama to Azure OpenAI API that weren't explicitly covered in the main instructions.

## 1. Model Provider Enum Migration

The `ModelProvider` enum was updated to include Azure as a provider type. The default provider in `LanguageModelSD` was changed from Ollama to Azure to reflect the new primary API service.

## 2. Error Handling Improvements

The Azure implementation includes more robust error handling compared to the original Ollama implementation:

- Detailed HTTP status code reporting in error messages
- Proper handling of non-streaming responses
- Better management of connection timeouts
- Improved error propagation to the UI

## 3. Streaming Implementation Differences

The Azure OpenAI API uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming, which required a different approach than Ollama's streaming:

- Implemented a custom `SSEDelegate` class to handle the event stream
- Added buffer management for processing chunked responses
- Implemented proper stream termination detection with `[DONE]` marker

## 4. Settings UI Enhancements

The Settings UI was enhanced to provide a better user experience for Azure OpenAI:

- Added a deployment management interface with add/delete functionality
- Included image support toggle for vision-capable models
- Improved the visual layout and organization of settings

## 5. SwiftData Extensions

Added extensions to SwiftDataService to support:

- Deleting specific models (rather than all models)
- Deleting specific messages (for conversation trimming)
- Better handling of model registration and context management

## 6. Backward Compatibility Considerations

While the implementation focuses on Azure OpenAI API, some considerations for backward compatibility were made:

- The model structure maintains compatibility with existing SwiftData schemas
- Conversation and message structures remain largely unchanged
- The UI flow and user experience remain consistent

## 7. Security Improvements

The Azure implementation includes several security improvements:

- API keys are stored securely and never logged
- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Request/response logging is limited to avoid exposing sensitive data

## 8. Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations were implemented:

- Throttled UI updates during streaming to prevent UI freezes
- Efficient buffer management for streaming responses
- Proper task cancellation and resource cleanup

## 9. Removed Dependencies

The following dependencies are no longer needed:

- OllamaKit package (can be removed from the project)
- Any Ollama-specific utilities or extensions

## 10. Future Considerations

For future development, consider:

- Implementing token counting and usage tracking
- Adding support for function calling capabilities in newer Azure OpenAI models
- Implementing a more sophisticated model capability detection system
- Adding support for Azure OpenAI's fine-tuning capabilities
